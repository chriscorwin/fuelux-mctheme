// The columns configure icon has a little gear sticking out of it, making it need to be bigger than the other column type icons in a repeater toolbar, so that the columns box itself appears to be the same size. The margin-bottom is so that it aligns correctly, and it's container button is the same size as the rest of the buttons in the toolbar.
